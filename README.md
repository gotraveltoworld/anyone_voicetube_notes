## Outline
This project is for learning English with the partners.

We used the everyday "Pronunciation Challenge" service of voicetube[[vt](https://tw.voicetube.com/everyday)].

Every day, this service has a teacher to instruct everyone how to learn this short passage.

So we can learn English from this teacher. When we finished this challenge, we will write a new note from the teacher's record.

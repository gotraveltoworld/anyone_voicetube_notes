> 為何所有城市都擺脫不了老鼠？ (Why Cities Can’t Get Rid Of Rats) <br>
> They're extremely patient when it comes to new foods. They'll taste just a tiny portion at first, wait to see if that food makes them sick, and only if it doesn't will they consume the rest. This is called delayed learning, and it's why rats are notoriously difficult to poison. <br>
> 牠們一開始只會先嘗一小部分，等等看食物是否會讓牠們生病，如果沒事，牠們才會吃完剩下的食物。這叫做延遲學習，這也是為什麼老鼠臭名昭彰地難以中毒的原因。 <br>

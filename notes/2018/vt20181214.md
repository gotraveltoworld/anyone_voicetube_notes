> 如何讓寫作更生動 (How to write descriptively) <br>
> We read fiction for many reasons. To be entertained, to find out who done it, to travel to strange, new planets, to be scared, to laugh, to cry, to think, to feel, to be so absorbed that for a while we forget where we are.  <br>
> 我們為了種種的理由看小說。為了娛樂自己，為了找出嫌疑犯，為了旅行到一個陌生的新星球，為了被嚇，為了開懷大笑，為了放聲大哭，為了思考，為了感受，為了沉浸其中而暫時忘記身在何處。 <br>

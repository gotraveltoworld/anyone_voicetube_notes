> There are apparently over 80,000 Chinese characters, which can seem pretty intimidating – but guess what you only need to know 3,500 in Standard Chinese. This might still seem like a lot, but you can actually get by with only 1,000 of the most frequent characters. <br>
> 中文字有超過八萬個，似乎很令人卻步，但是你只需要知道官話的 3500 字就好。好像還是很多，但其實掌握 1000 個最常用的字就沒問題。 <br>

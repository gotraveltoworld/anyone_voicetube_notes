> On top of this, create something called an "accountability chart" to document your progress. In one column, write the timespan, and in the other, the activities you accomplished during this time. Similar to those on a diet who document their food intake, writing down your progress allows you to realistically evaluate your work, as opposed to inaccurately assuming what you've done.  <br>
> 除此之外，做個「責任圖表」來記錄自己的進度：在其中一欄填入所花費的時間，另一欄填入時間內完成的事情。這有點像是在減肥的人會紀錄攝取的熱量，記錄進度可以讓你真實地評估你的工作，而非不精確地以為自己完成了什麼。 <br>

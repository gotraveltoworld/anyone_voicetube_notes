## learning points
* 加s的規則：
    - declines => z 的結尾(有聲子音), dogs, beds
    - books => s 的結尾(無聲子音), truths
1. _
	* decline [dɪˋklaɪn] (v.) 下降；衰退
        - The decline means to get worse and worse so if a country's economy declines it means that the economy is not doing so well. And if your health declines it means that your health is getting worse and worse.
2. _
	* decay [dɪˋke] (v.) 腐朽；蛀蝕
        - Decay means to start to rot or start to die. For example, if you leave an apple on a desk for too long so maybe a few weeks it would start to rot or it would start to decay. When we get old our body starts to decay which is kind of a scary thought. And the word decay can also be used simply to mean to get worse and worse or to get worse and worse in condition. For example, a building after a hundred years old would start to show signs of decay.
3. _
	* decade [ˋdɛked] (n.) 十；十年
        - A decade means ten years. So if I say that I've worked in this company for a decade it means that I've worked here for 10 years. If I say that I played piano for a decade it means that I played the piano for 10 years. Similarly, a hundred years is called a century and the thousand years is called a millennium.
            + decade, century, millennium

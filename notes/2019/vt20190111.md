> 影片推薦如何讓你追劇追不停？ (Why your Netflix thumbnails don't look like mine) <br>
> How do you pick what to watch? Is it a catchy title? Maybe an interesting synopsis? Perhaps it's the unwillingness to watch another episode of The Office... Or just maybe, a particular piece of cover art speaks to your spirit?  <br>
> 你是怎麼決定要挑哪部來看的呢？是根據吸睛的標題？是看到感興趣的影片簡介？還是逼不得已再繼續觀賞一集《我們的辦公室》(美國情境喜劇)？也可能是某部影片的主視覺設計讓你一見鍾情？ <br>

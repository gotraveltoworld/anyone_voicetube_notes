## learning points
1. _
	* nourishing [ˋnɝɪʃɪŋ] (adj.) 富有營養的
        - nourishing comes from the verb to nourish so if something is nourishing it is full of good things inside and it's good for you, it's healthy for you. For example, a basket of fruits is nourishing cuz it contains a lot of nutrients. The fruits contain a lot of nutrients actions can also be nourishing. So talking to your friends when you're lonely can be nourishing cuz it's healthy for you
	* nutritious [njuˋtrɪʃəs] (adj.) 營養豐富的；營養價值高的
	* beneficial [͵bɛnəˋfɪʃəl] (adj.) 有益的；有用的；有利的

2. _
	* toxic [ˋtɑksɪk] (adj.) 有毒的；引起中毒的
        - toxic would be the opposite of nursing. If something is toxic is bad for your health it's poisonous. For example, you should not live near a garbage dump because garbage dumps are toxic to your health.
	* poisonous [ˋpɔɪznəs] (adj.) 有毒的；有害的

3. _
	* drain [dren] (v.) (使) 排出；(使) 排放；放乾 (液體) ˈnɜrɪʃɪŋ
        - Drain means to suck out all your energy. For example, you can say that exercise really drains you cuz when you exercise you lose your energy. In the passage, it says that a bad relationship can drain you so that's also a good way to use the word.

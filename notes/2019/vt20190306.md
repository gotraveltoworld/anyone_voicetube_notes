	* ingrained [ɪnˋgrend] (adj.) (觀念) 根深蒂固的
        - if you believe that is ingrained then that belief for you is firmly held and it's not likely to change so if your parents told you from a very young age that you need to save up money to buy a home. then that believe may be very deeply ingrained inside of you. And as you grow up you would always think that all I need to buy a home, I need to buy a home.

        - 發音跟noun project, 不同

For example, you can project the number of subscribers you would have by the end of the year.

> 【參加挑戰拿大獎】Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran (Ed Sheeran - Thinking Out Loud) <br>
> When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades, and the crowds don’t remember my name, when my hands don’t play the strings the same way, I know you will still love me the same. <br>
> 當我所有的頭髮都掉光、記憶逐漸衰退，世人都不記得我的名字，當我的手指無法再這樣彈奏和弦，我知道你還是會繼續這樣愛著我。 <br>

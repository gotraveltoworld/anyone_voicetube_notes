> 2020 歐巴馬對畢業生的致詞 (ft. Obamaa) <br>
> Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy, that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way, which is why things are so screwed up. <br>
> 做感到愉快、省事且簡單的事，是小孩子們所想的。不幸的是，許多所謂的成人，包含一些有著華麗職稱和有影響力工作的人，仍然以那種方式思考，這就是事情搞砸的原因。 <br>

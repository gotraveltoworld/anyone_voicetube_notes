> 如果能回到過去 我想和媽媽說... (What I Wish I Could Have Told My Mom) <br>
> I wish you could see the woman that I've grown into. I wish I knew which flowers you liked and that I could put them in your hands, rather than on a plot of grass with your name on it. <br>
> 多希望妳能夠見到我所成為的女性。我希望我知道妳喜歡哪種花，也希望我可以將它們親手送給妳，而不是放在寫著妳名字的一塊草皮上。 <br>

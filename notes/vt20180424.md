> 【TED-Ed】瞭解上台恐懼 並且克服它 (The science of stage fright (and how to overcome it) - Mikael Cho)<br>
> Since stage fright is natural and inevitable, focus on what you can control. Practice a lot, starting long before in an environment similar to the real performance. Practicing any task increases your familiarity and reduces anxiety, so when it's time to speak in public, you're confident in yourself and the task at hand.<br>
> 所以專注在你可以控制的事物上。提前找一個近似於真實演出環境的地方，練習可以同時增加你的純熟度並減少你的焦慮，於是到了實際公開演說的時候，你對自已及手上的任務就會充滿自信。<br>

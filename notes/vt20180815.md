> 視障者怎麼作夢？ (How Blind People Dream) <br>
> So I've been blind since birth, so I've never seen anything in my life, so one of the things that you guys wonder about, is if I can see in my dreams. And I think because I've never seen in real life, my subconscious doesn't know what it'd be like to see either, so no. I don't see in my dreams. <br>
> 我天生就看不見，所以我一生中從未看過任何東西，你們大家很好奇的一件事，就是我在夢裡是否看得見。我猜是因為我在現實生活中沒有看見過，我的潛意識也不知道看見的感覺，所以，不。我在夢裡也看不到。 <br>

> 為何追求真愛如此困難？5 個原因 (5 Reasons Finding Love is Too Difficult For Some) <br>
> Sometimes, we hold ourselves back more than we like to admit due to fears and high expectations.

It's all about recognizing how many opportunities you've taken away from yourself. <br>
> 有時候，我們因為恐懼以及高度期待而退縮。如果某人去約會，這並不代表他們要給予你一生的承諾，或是想隨便找個人穩定下來。要認清自己到底從手中放掉過多少機會。 <br>

> 穿上那些所謂「不適合」我們身材的衣服 (We Tried The "Wrong" Clothes For Our Shape) <br>
> I would totally recommend this challenge to other people, especially if you're kind of stuck in your ways as to what you think you can wear. Just forget about what you should wear and just try out new things, no matter what. <br>
> 我還會推薦這挑戰給其他人，特別是那種只走自己風格的人，或是在想自己可以穿什麼的人。別去想你該穿什麼，就試試各種新事物吧！ <br>

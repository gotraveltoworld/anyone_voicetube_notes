## learning points
1. _
	* pharma [ˋfɑrmə] (n.) 製藥業
		- This is a a short form about medicine.
		- Pharma as a prefix that it is talking about medicine.
	* pharmacy [ˋfɑrməsɪ] (n.) 藥局；藥房
		- Pharmacy is somewhere where they sell medicine. Some people call it a drugstore but also depending on where you are in the world. Some people will call pharmacies and drug stores different things, I call them the same thing. They usually sell medicine and toothpaste and stuff like that. That's a pharmacy.
	* pharmaceuticals  [fɑrməˋsjutɪk!z] (n.) 藥物
		- A fancy word for medicine.
		- For example, if you work for a company that makes medicine, you would usually say that you work for a pharmaceutical company.
		- pharmaceuticals company. => 製藥公司

2. _
	* bio-tech [] (n.) 生物技術
		- This is a a short form of two different words.
		- This is the combination of biology and technology
		- biology + technology => bio-tech => food products.
	* biology [baɪˋɑlədʒɪ] (n.) 生物學
	* technology [tɛkˋnɑlədʒɪ] (n.) 技術

3. _
	* a bunch [e bʌntʃ] (phr.) 一堆
		- I have some sugar,  I have a lot sugar,  I have a bunch sugar (比較描述數量的多寡)
		- I say a little bit of sugar that's not much and then some sugar is more than that. If you have a lot of sugar that means that if you have a big bag of sugar. That is a lot of sugar so where does a bunch fit into all of this. I personally I think a bunch is maybe between some and a lot. Some doesn't sound like very much and a lot sounds like a lot, of course. So a bunch I think it's somewhere between that. You know I got a bunch of sugar means like a good amount. You know a pretty decent amount of sugar but not a lot but still more than some. that is my very unscientific explanation of a bunch. A bunch can also mean, you know, a bunch of flowers or something like that meaning like a group of flowers. A bundle of flowers. Right, a bunch can also mean that something is in a group but it often used to describe an amount of something.
	* a lot [e lɑt] (phr.) 很多
	* some [sʌm] (pron.) 一些

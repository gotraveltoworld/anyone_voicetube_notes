        - There are few different meaning. One usage is when you're on the phone. => 含意比較少，擱置或是插播(電話)。
        - If you're on hold on the phone and means someone on the other end got off a phone but they didn't hang up they put you on hold and then you hear that you know Bebe beep beep sound that's when you're on hold.
        - So you could say I've been on hold for an hour now. Means you can wait in there on hold for a long time. To put something on hold also means that you kind of put it to the side that you don't worry about it. You don't deal with it maybe usually temporarily.
        - I think we're going to put this issue on hold while we work on other more important things. So that means all right we're not going to deal with this right now. We need to put it on hold which means put it to the side right don't touch it for now and we're going to do other things in the meantime. => 處理其他事情，可以先擱置。
	* hold up [] (phr.) 延誤

	* cartoon [kɑrˋtun] (n.) 卡通
        - What is the difference between a cartoon and an animation? As a very good question. So firstly the animation is any kind of moving picture video basically includes a lot of different kinds of animation and cartoons are one kind of animation.
        - Cartoons are the kind that is you know drawn and there are flat and usually, you know colorful and all that stuff and then there's another kind of Animation called anime. Anime is specifically the Japanese style of cartooning I think anime is a kind of cartoon as well.

	* complex [ˋkɑmplɛks] (adj.) 複合的
        - Complex as an adjective.
        - The complex has the emphasis on the flex complex but if you put the emphasis on the first syllable it becomes a noun. It means something totally different and actually is a combo meaning but one of the meanings is like a building that acts as a hub for something like a center. For example, just like the Student Center that I can hear things like a student center at the University or college made the student center of the activity center.
        - it means that when it's used as an adjectives complex it means that something has a lot of different pieces a lot of layers a lot of different you know components to something.
	* complicated [ˋkɑmplə͵ketɪd] (adj.) 複雜的
        - complicated and actually a lot of native speakers use these interchangeably and probably. Many them couldn't tell you the difference. I actually had to double check on the internet but there is one important difference. That is complicated is kind of more negative but it kind of implies that something is has a lot of pieces and is complicated in a bad way. => 有一點點負面的意思。
        - For example, it is a perfect example if you know the Avril Lavigne song complicated. You know her lying why'd you have to go and make things so complicated.
        - Basically, if you make something complicated. It kind of means that you make it hard to understand or you know harder to understand. That it should be where is if something is complex it just means that it has a lot of pieces or that has a lot of layers. Something that's complex can still be easy to understand but something that's complicated is kind of has the idea. you know being inefficient almost sometimes or yeah just generally difficult to understand. And make things complex but just don't make them complicated stuff like that.

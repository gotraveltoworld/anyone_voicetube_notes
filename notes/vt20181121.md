These are businesses that never adapted.  They cross their fingers that this internet thing would be a fad and kept selling the exact same products that Amazon is great for. <br>
> 這些是從不接受改變的企業，他們祈禱網路只是一時的流行，然後持續銷售那些亞馬遜能提供更好的相同產品。 <br>

## learning points
1. _
	* adapt [əˋdæpt] (v.) 使適應
        - It means to adjust to new conditions or to adjust to a new environment.
        - For example, if you get a new job you need to adapt to that new job if you move to a new country you would need to adapt cause the new country is not going to adapt to you so you need to adapt to the new country.
	* acclimate [əˋklaɪmɪt] (v.) əˋklaɪmə͵taɪz
	* fit [fɪt] (v.) 適合的
2. _
	* to cross one's fingers [] (phr.) 祈求好運；希望
        - This is a hand gesture and that involves crossing your index finger on your middle finger. Crossing those two fingers and it's a hand gesture that is commonly used when you're wishing for a luck. I don't how often the men actually do the hand gesture. I don't think a lot of people actually do the hand gesture but it's still a commonly used phrase. So for example you can say that "you're keeping your fingers crossed that you're going to find your dog soon". So instead of saying that I hope I can find my dog soon, you can say I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I can find my dog soon that's the same thing.
3. _
	* fad [fæd] (n.) 一時的流行
        - It's sad as something that is popular for a short while and then becomes unpopular very soon after.
        - An example of a fad would be those fidget spinner things that everybody seems to have 2 years ago that  Pokemon go would also be a fad. Pokemon go as one of those things that I thought would not be a fad but it turned out to be a fad anyways.
	* trend [trɛnd] (n.) 趨勢；時尚
	* craze [krez] (n.) 狂熱；風尚

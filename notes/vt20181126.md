> 【TED】邁克爾比魯特: 倫敦地鐵地圖的天才構想 (The genius of the London Tube Map | Small Thing Big Idea, a TED series) <br>
> You can see rivers, bodies of water, trees and parks — the stations were all crammed together at the center of the map, and out in the periphery, there were some that couldn't even fit on the map. <br>
> 你會看到河流、水體、樹木、公園 — 地鐵站都擠在地圖上的中心區域，在外圍地區，有些車站 位置甚至跟地圖不吻合。 <br>

> 為什麼嬰兒不能喝水 (Why Babies Can't Drink Water?) <br>
> In fact, most cases of water intoxication in infants don't even involve a glass of water. A common mistake is when people dilute baby formula too much by accident, or when parents dunk their infants up and down in a swimming pool, and in the process the infant gulps in too much water.  <br>
> 事實上，大部分嬰兒水中毒的案件甚至只喝了不到一杯水。最常見的錯誤是當人們不小心過度稀釋配方奶，或者是父母讓嬰兒上上下下的浸泡在游泳池當中，而期間嬰兒吞下過多的水。 <br>

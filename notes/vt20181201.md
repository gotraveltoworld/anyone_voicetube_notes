> 「摔倒在你甘願摔下的路上！」超震撼畢業演講 (Charlie Day, Merrimack College Alum  <br>
> And I don't think you should do just what makes you happy, I think you should do what makes you great. Do what's uncomfortable, and scary, and hard, but pays off in the long run. Be willing to fail. Let yourself fail. Fail in the way and the place where you would want to fail. <br>
> 而且我不覺得你們應該要做讓自己開心的事，你們應該要做讓自己變得更好的事。跨出你的舒適圈，做一些讓你害怕、辛苦，但長期下來會得到收穫的事。要甘願失敗，讓自己失敗，用你想要的方式跌在你想失敗的地方。 <br>

> 【TED-Ed】 亞馬遜女戰士真的存在嗎？ (Did the Amazons really exist? - Adrienne Mayor) <br>
> Were Amazons merely figures of myth, or something more? It was long assumed that they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, stories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. <br>
> 亞馬遜戰士只是神話人物嗎？ 還是並不只如此？長久以來，人們認為他們是想像出來的，就像獨眼巨人與人馬一樣。可讓人感到好奇的是， 古埃及、波斯、中東、中亞、印度以及中國的故事皆有提到像亞馬遜族的女戰士。 <br>

> Public opinion, or what gets called "common sense," is sensible and reasonable in countless areas. It’s what you hear about from friends and neighbors; the stuff you take in without even thinking about it, but common sense is also often full of daftness and error.  <br>
> 輿論—或是所謂的「常識」—在無數個方面來說是明智且合理的。輿論是我們從朋友跟鄰居那聽來的，是我們不加思索就全然接受的東西。但常識也經常充滿愚昧以及錯誤。 <br>

> 【TED-Ed】灰塵是由什麼組成的？(What is dust made of? - Michael Marder) <br>
> In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins of dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood or even house–something that may be of great help for forensic specialists. <br>
> 在未來，我們或許可以把灰塵樣本的來源定位得更加詳盡，縮小範圍到一個特定住宅區或甚至是房子，這可能將會大大幫助法庭相關人士。 <br>

> The only person who knows what your north star is, is you. At the end of your life, you will not regret pursuing that thing that you always wanted to do or that little thing that you at least wanted to try. Follow it no matter how crazy or weird it may seem to other people, you don't wanna die with regret. <br>
> 知道你的「北極星」的人只有你自己。到了生命最後，你就不會後悔，追求過自己想要的目標或是生命中自己想要嘗試的事。堅持住，不論那目標在旁人眼中，有多瘋狂或詭異，畢竟你不會在生命中留下遺憾。 <br>

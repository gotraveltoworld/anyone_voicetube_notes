> 你有高功能憂鬱症嗎？(7 Signs You May Have High Functioning Depression) <br>
> Number 4: You feel misunderstood. Since most high functioning depressives can maintain a job, a house, and their responsibilities, people underestimate how much anguish they're going through. <br>
> 第四：你覺得不被理解。由於大多數患有高功能憂鬱症的人都能保有工作、做好家事、完成本分，因此他人低估了他們的痛苦，也不把他們的苦當一回事，因為他們表現得不像一般憂鬱症患者。 <br>

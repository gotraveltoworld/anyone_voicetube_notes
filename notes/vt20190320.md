## learning points
* Remember how to use some words and context.
1. _
	* the economy  [] (m.) 經濟；經濟制度
        - The relationship between production trade in the supply of money in a particular country or region.
        - The world economy.
2. _
	* economic [͵ikəˋnɑmɪk] (adj.) 經濟的
        - It means connected with trade in the industry and the development of a country => economic growth.
        - Reinforce your understanding => context
3. _
	* economics [͵ikəˋnɑmɪks] (n.)  經濟學
        - It means the study of how a society organizes money, trade, and industry.
        - study economics or economics is a difficult subject to learn.
4. _
	* monetary [ˋmʌnə͵tɛrɪ] (adj.) 貨幣的；金融的
        - means relating to money especially all the money in a particular country
        - I would use monetary policy.
        - The government uses monetary policy to lower its interest rates and increase spending.
5. _
	* fiscal  [ˋfɪsk!] (adj.) 財政的；國庫的
        - it means connected with government or public money especially taxes but it's still kind of difficult to remember. So I usually associate a monetary policy with interest rates in fiscal policy with taxes. So I can say a sentence like this the government uses monetary policy to lower interest rate and uses fiscal policy to decrease taxes, both of these policies can help the government increase spending and fight recession.

			+ feature 用法

2. _
	* black coffee [blæk ˋkɔfɪ] (n.)  黑咖啡
		-  it's the kind that just has coffee and water.

3. _
	* roast [rost] (v.) 烤，焙； 嚴厲批評，非難
		- To cook by having something in dry heat, say in an oven and when making coffee usually you'll use heat to dry the coffee beans. Roast is also used as a slang term, it means to have a witty comeback or a funny criticism. What I mean by that is if someone says something to you that's kind of mean and you want to say something back. Someone will say it and it could be something that's really funny or really smart that they're saying back to the person that was being mean to them and that can be called as roasting the other person.
